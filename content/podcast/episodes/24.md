Nick and James talks about the recent Solana Bootcamp/workshop that the Solana
Foundation’s DevRel team hosted in the NYC office. Plus the Solana NYC
hackerhouse has just come to a close and it was amazing!

Huge thanks to all the show listeners that met Nick at the NYC hackerhouse and
said they were a fan or listener of the show! It’s things like this that
motivate us to keep doing this show!

In light of the recent SEC lawsuits alleging that many top cryptocurrencies and
tokens are securities, we talk at a high level what some of the allegations are
and what it could me.

James expresses his opinion about this market reaction to this news to be an
overcorrection and that “we will weather it, and we will be fine”.
