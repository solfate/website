Solana content creator and educator, Andy (aka SolAndy), makes a guest
appearance. Andy shares his background and how he first started creating content
for the Solana ecosystem. (It was with bounties!)

After not participating in the MadLad, Nick gave in an purchased a MadLad. Andy
describe the experience of minting MadLabs through the xNFT directly in the
Backpack wallet.

As educators, James and Andy talk about what they think is the best of how to
learn Solana development: project based learning. And why some good developer
content appears more over others on platforms like YouTube.

Fun fact: Did you know that Andy used to be a university professor?
