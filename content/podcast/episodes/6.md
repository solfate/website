James and Nick welcome [Vibhu](https://twitter.com/vibhu), founder of Solana
Spaces and the [DRiP.haus](http://drip.haus), on to the episode where they talk
about programable NFTs and the mutability of NFTs and data storage.

Nick seems passionate about some NFTs staying immutable, while Vibhu and James
are less convinced. But everyone seems to agree the “wallet” terminology might
need a refresh.
