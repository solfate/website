After James received his Saga developer test phone, and Nick’s is inbound, they
discuss possibilities of a mobile first crypto experience. Even the potential
for non-crypto apps getting distribution on a decentralized app store.

Nick started using Midjourney to generate custom AI artwork, and James may
convince his wife to use crypto before Nick convinces his own wife.
