While blockchain is still a new industry, the sub section of “blockchain gaming”
is even newer and largely considered a very strong use case of blockchain
technology. [Michael Wagner](https://twitter.com/at_mwagner), co-founder and CEO
of [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com) joins to explain how Star Atlas is using
the Solana blockchain within the game’s infrastructure and economy.

Michael give his backstory of being a life long gamer and working in the
financial sector before diving full time into crypto by founding a
crypto/cannabis company called Tokes. (which is also a interesting use case for
crypto payments due to common restrictions within several countries like the US)

We talk about how the Star Atlas intellectual property (IP), like the in game
asset, can be used by other creatives and entrepreneurs to create sizable
businesses off of. Including physical merchandise, digital goods, and in game
merchants. There is an application process for this, but still a very uncommon
things for a large scale production like Star Atlas. (Which we think very
amazing to see!)

Michael describes the 3 different game “applications”, almost like individual
game clients, the company is building. Each will allow players to interact with
specific parts of the same on chain game data, so they are all still tied to the
game.

Included with all the on-chain game data is the movement system, which recently
had a public stress test in the form of a mini game. Around 10k unique wallets
interacted with the Escape Velocity mini game during Star Atlas’ movement stress
test (which resulted in around 80 million transactions over 72 days )

Finally, we dive deep into the very complex digital economy being built within
the game. Including several factors the company is taking into account for
growing a truly sustainable economy and carefully fostering it to reach
stability. This is especially interesting considering players will have the
potential to have sizable monetary value participating within this economy.
