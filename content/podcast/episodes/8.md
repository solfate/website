Big news! Nick just started his new full time job on the DevRel team at Solana
Foundation! James also declares he is going to finally get a hardware wallet and
rethink how he handles wallet security.

PS: In case you missed it last week, we had a long conversation with the CEO and
founder of Solana Spaces, Vibhu, about
[why Solana Spaces is shutting down](https://solfate.com/podcast/7.5) its
NYC/Miami stores. Give it a listen and show your support to Vibhu!
