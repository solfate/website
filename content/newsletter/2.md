## Stripe Crypto Payments

During a
[live demo](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7189327311895232515/)
at Stripe Sessions on April 25th, Stripe Co-Founder John Collison demoed the
upcoming crypto payments product which utilizes USDC payments via Solana!

In a

by Stripe's Head of Crypto John Egan, the product is said to be coming to the
Stripe Optimized Checkout Suite this summer. Users will be able to pay for items
via USDC, and merchants will be able to instantly cash out these crypto payments
to fiat currency.

## Jupiter x Ultimate Wallet Acquisition

Jupiter has recently announced their acquisition of
[Ultimate Wallet](https://twitter.com/UltimateApp) and its mobile team. The
current Ultimate App will sunset on May 22, 2024, and after the closing date
users will only be able to recover their Ultimate Wallet recovery phrases.

With the Ultimate Wallet team acquisition, the Jupiter team looks to expand on
their
[mobile product](https://twitter.com/JupiterExchange/status/1782763931292889561),
offering a better user experience for new and existing users.

## Only1 Strategic Funding Round

Only1 has announced its $1.3M strategic funding round led by Newman Group to
continue building the “OnlyFans of Solana”, offering creators a decentralized
payment settlement layer for membership-gated content. The team is said to be
actively partnering with agencies in Japan, SEA, and LA to bring more creators
onto the platform.

## Coinbase Wallet x Solana

Coinbase Wallet has released a new Solana DEX integration, allowing users to
access and trade over 50,000+ SPL tokens. This opens the door for more CEX users
to gain access to the Solana ecosystem, past a restrictive token list.
