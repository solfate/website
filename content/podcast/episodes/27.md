We are joined by David (aka [thehasheddude](https://twitter.com/thehasheddude)),
the founder of [MadShield](https://www.madshield.xyz/) (formerly SolShield) and
infamous twitter personality on crypto-twitter. His primary focus is on security
audits and bounties in the Solana ecosystem, and has audited the top tier
projects from around the Solana ecosystem.

David shares his mindset of how goes through performing a security audit,
including some of the common bugs/exploits he sees. Including how he recommends
getting started as a security auditor.

One of my favorite parts is David’s mindset around finding the security
vulnerabilities and why he is not tempted to use the exploits to extract funds.
Finding the exploits and building relationships with the teams is so motivating
for him.
