A conversation with Dave Taylor, CEO of Etherfuse, about Etherfuse's stablebonds as an essential blockchain primitive for foreign exchange.

## Summary

In this episode of the Solfate Podcast, hosts James and Nick welcome Dave Taylor, CEO of Etherfuse, to discuss their groundbreaking approach to bringing real-world assets on-chain through tokenized government bonds called "stablebonds." The conversation explores how Etherfuse has navigated complex regulatory frameworks across Mexico, Switzerland, and other countries to create a new primitive for foreign exchange that could revolutionize how people access and trade international currencies. Dave shares insights on building in the RWA space, the technical challenges of tokenizing government debt, and how stablebonds are already outcompeting traditional remittance solutions by 200,000x in daily volume while making foreign exchange more accessible and affordable for everyone.
