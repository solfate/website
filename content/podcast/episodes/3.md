James and Nick talk about ordering their Saga phones, including the Saga cards
airdrop. They explore the idea of digital collectibles over time and how
business may use them to entire consumers down the line.

The gents talk multi-chain and the Phantom wallet, then Nick baits James into a
personal hackathon by first offering him $BONK to ship a mobile app within 2
weeks of getting his Saga phone. James refuses the $BONK offer but counter
requests a [Solana Spaces](https://solanaspaces.com) NFT from the
[drip.haus](http://drip.haus) airdrops.

PS: After getting rugged on the first try recording _THE ENTIRE EPISODE_, Nick
and James recorded an entire new episode for this week. You may notice some
mentions of that throughout the episode :)
