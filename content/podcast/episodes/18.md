In this episode, we are joined by
[Chris Osborn](https://twitter.com/aliquotchris), founder of
[Dialect](https://www.dialect.to/), the very well known wallet-to-wallet chat
app on Solana.

We talk about the Dialect team pioneering two interesting pieces of technology,
each trying to accomplish a different goal:

1. smart messages, and
2. NFT chat stickers

Smart messages allow links to have built in “calls to action” that a viewer can
immediately take an action on, directly from the chat window. Imagine if you
could directly book a reservation within your message window by clicking a
simple button. Or if you needed to sign and send a crypto transaction to prevent
being liquidated from an open trade position.

Dialect’s NFT chat stickers give another new social experience around collecting
“chat stickers” many are used to withing other messaging apps, but with some
extra added delight for users. The sticker packs are free to mint NFTs by
various projects and community on Solana, and are minted like opening of pack of
trading cards. Each filled with random stickers to collect. It is as wonderfully
fun experience!
