The hackathon winners and founders of Underdog,
[Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevarifin) and
[Tony](https://twitter.com/tonyplasencia3), join to talk about the NFT
infrastructure landscape. Including compressed nfts and various interesting NFT
use cases that do not include the typical pfp experience.

We all discuss how Solana seemingly does a better job than other blockchains in
utilizing NFTs for non-pfp use cases. Including web3 cookies, on-chain
membership systems, and even “MailChimp for web3”.

PS: The way the Underdog founders are thinking about building a system/program
that enables non transferrable compressed nfts, especially that facilitates data
that is not just “typical NFT” data is very very clever.
