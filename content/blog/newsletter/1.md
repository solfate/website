Welcome to the first edition of the [Solfate Snapshot](/snapshot) newsletter,
where we’ll be diving into some of the biggest updates from Solana ecosystem
teams and builders from the last week! Last week we saw many new product
launches, NFT standards, and protocol features entering the space.

## Snapshot

- **Switchboard**: Introduces On-Demand for Solana, offering cost-effective data
  requests and improved security.
- **Marginfi**: Enables loan repayment using existing deposits, reducing
  friction with flash loan implementations.
- **Metaplex**: Launches Core NFT standard on Solana, reducing costs and
  complexity for developers.
- **Helius**: Releases Automatic Private Nodes globally, allowing customizable
  node setups.
- **Circle**: Unveils Solana support for the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol
  (CCTP), enabling seamless USDC transfer across 8 blockchains.
- **Kamino**: Upgrades Lend & Multiply with improved transparency, UI
  enhancements, and oracle infrastructure.

## Switchboard

The Switchboard team recently announced the launch of Switchboard On-Demand for
Solana devnet!

Switchboard On-Demand looks to offer a more user-centric solution compared to
its previous push model with:

- **Cost Effective Data Requests**: Removes high gas fees associated with old
  push model
- **Simplified Integration Process**: No need to manage on-chain feed
  definitions or rely on the oracle for periodic updates
- **Improved Security Features**: Now utilizing Intel’s Software Guard
  Extensions

## Marginfi

A new feature has been introduced to the marginfi platform, allowing users to
repay their loans using their existing deposits on the platform. This new
feature utilizes flash loan implementations to help reduce the friction of
repaying active loans.

## Metaplex

Metaplex recently introduced
[Core](https://twitter.com/metaplex/status/1774819025828376925), a new NFT
standard on Solana, now live on devnet. The new Core standard aims to reduce
costs and simplify the development experience for builders.

Here is how Core looks to benefit the NFT developer experience and the overall
Solana ecosystem:

- All key data can be stored on a single on-chain account
- Reduces complexity for devs, resulting in the cheapest minting cost vs.
  programmable NFTs
- Makes digital asset interactions lighter on the Solana network
- Integrated a highly flexible plugin system
- Allows users to expand upon the functionality of Core assets without waiting
  for updates of the standard
- Will be fully supported by the Metaplex Developer Platform, ready to integrate
  with a variety of SDKs and utility programs

## Helius

Helius recently released Automatic Private Nodes, allowing users to spin up
their own RPC or Geyser nodes globally! Through the Helius dashboard, you are
able to select and modify: node size (24 CPU cores & 256 GB of RAM or 32 CPU
cores & 1TB of RAM), location, Solana Client, and optional Geyser plugins.

After selecting your preferences, your node will be available immediately if
inventory is available, and if not email notifications are sent for status
updates as the Helius team orders new nodes.

## Circle

Circle launched their Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) on Solana, allowing
protocols and users to transfer their $USDC seamlessly across 8 different
blockchains with 1:1 capital efficiency.

Utilizing the CCTP’s native burn-and-mint process, Solana devs should have a
much more seamless experience in creating cross-chain onboarding flows. CCTP
will enable protocols and exchanges to accept USDC on any of the supported
chains, and rebalance their final holding behind the scenes.

Currently Supports: Solana, Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism,
Polygon, & Noble

## Kamino

The Kamino Lend & Multiply products have been upgraded, improving the
transparency and UX of the platform.

- Kamino Lend: Interest earned is now displayed on the Lend UI
- Live price-impact data has been integrated into the Kamino UI, providing more
  clear price impact estimates for the Multiply product
- Improved Multiply experience due to an upgrade with oracle infrastructure

Thanks for tuning into this week’s edition of the Solfate Snapshot! We’re
excited to see all the new innovations and improvements to protocols in the
Solana ecosystem, be sure to subscribe for your weekly Solana ecosystem update!
