Welcome to the very first episode of the Solfate podcast, an audio commentary
from two developers on building into the Solana ecosystem.

In this very first episode, Nick and James introduce themselves. We give our
backgrounds and how we each started building and educating on Solana.

We also talk about the recent events of the Bonk token taking Solana by storm.
Getting airdropped to loads of people (including us) and the impact that
community driven projects really have on the Solana blockchain.

We wrapped up the episode with talking about what we are each working on now and
in the near future.

Huge shout out to Jeffrey Ando ([@ser_ando](https://twitter.com/ser_ando)) for
the amazing AI generated cover art!
